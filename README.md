# Senior SDET Challenge - Loan Application API Testing

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

Your assignment is to test a loan application API. Build a robust test suite, identify defects, and provide additional technical documentation where needed.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

```bash
cd api
npm install
npm start
```
Server runs on `http://localhost:3000`

**Note**: The API starts with 5 pre-existing loan applications (APP-001 through APP-005) in various states for testing purposes.

## ðŸ“¡ API Documentation

The Loan Application API provides endpoints for managing loan applications through their lifecycle. All endpoints return JSON responses.

**Base URL:** `http://localhost:3000`

## ðŸ“Š Business Rules

### Core Approval Logic
1. **Income Requirements**: Minimum income of $30,000/year (inclusive)
2. **Loan Amount Limits**: Between $1,000 and $50,000 (inclusive)
3. **Required Fields**: firstName, lastName, email, income, amount
4. **Status Transitions**:
   - `pending` â†’ `approved`/`rejected`
   - `approved` â†’ `funded`
   - No transitions from `rejected` or `funded`

## ðŸŽ¯ Your Tasks

### 1. Write Comprehensive Tests
#### Create a test suite that covers:

- **Functional Tests**: Happy path scenarios, CRUD operations
- **Input Validation**: Required fields, data types, formats
- **Business Logic**: Income thresholds, amount limits
- **Error Handling**: Invalid requests, non-existent resources

#### Feel free to use whatever language, frameworks, and tools you're most comfortable with.

### 2. Find and Document Issues
Identify any issues or defects in the API behavior. Document your findings in `TEST_RESULTS.md`:

**Include for each bug:**
- Bug description and severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Request/response examples
- Business impact

### 3. Provide Test Documentation
In your `TEST_RESULTS.md`, include:
- Test execution instructions
- Bug report (see above)
- Test approach and strategy
- Framework choice justification
- Coverage summary


## ðŸ“š Resources

- Sample test data: `examples/test-data.json`
- API request examples: `examples/sample-requests.http`


## ðŸ“® Submission

1. Fork this repository
2. Create a new branch: `solution/[your-name]`
3. Commit your solution with clear history
4. Push to your fork
5. Create a Pull Request with:
   - Summary of your approach
   - Number of issues found
   - Any assumptions made

## ðŸ“‹ Deliverables

Please use the provided `TEST_RESULTS.md` template file to document your findings. The template includes sections for:
- Test execution instructions
- Issues found with detailed reproduction steps
- Test strategy and approach
- Framework choice justification
- Coverage summary and metrics

**Remember**: This challenge simulates real-world API testing scenarios. We value practical solutions, clear communication, and attention to detail. Show us how you would approach this in your day-to-day work as a Senior SDET.

**Good luck! ðŸš€**
